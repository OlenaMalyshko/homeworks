                    Customs and traditions of Ukrainian people are very diverse
                    and have deep roots in Trypillian culture, the periods of
                    the early Slavs and the Kyivan Rus; they arose from a mix of
                    a pagan and Christian background.

                    related to the main events of a family life (such as a
                    wedding, childbirth, christening, funerals etc.); and
                    seasonal rituals, which came from pre-Christian times and
                    connected with the agricultural activity and the years
                    cycle. All religious rites are frequently echoed with pagan
                    ones.</p>

                <p class="text">Talking about family traditions, the wedding is
                    the most interesting and complicated one. It started from
                    so-called brides ransom when a groom had to buyout a bride
                    from her parents. After the buyout, the bride and the groom
                    were blessed by their parents and went to a church for the
                    wedding. The important attributes of the wedding ceremony
                    were special wedding bread and embroidered towels as the
                    symbols of welfare and happiness.Traditional Ukrainian
                    wedding is bustling and cheerful, accomplished with jokes,
                    music, dancing. In past times, a wedding could last for a
                    week. Unfortunately, nowadays it is only one or two days
                    long.</p>
